title: "Network-conscious compressed image transmission over battlefield networks"

excerpt:
   >-   

   We introduce an image compression and transmission system for
   battlefield networks. The system is based on network-conscious
   image compression, an approach to compression that does not simply
   maximize compression, but which optimizes overall performance when
   compressed images are transmitted over a lossy, packet-switched
   battlefield network. Using an application level framing philosophy,
   an image is compressed into path-maximum transmission unit-size
   application data units (ADUs) at the application layer. Each ADU is
   independent of others and carries its own semantics, that is, each
   ADU is a self-contained unit possessing all information necessary
   for decoding and displaying the information within that
   packet. Each independent ADU can be delivered to the receiving
   application out-of-order, thereby enabling faster progressive
   display of the image. We combine network-conscious image
   compression with an embedded focusing feature to provide a system
   that can be used in battlefield scenarios such as telemedicine or
   intelligence gathering.
