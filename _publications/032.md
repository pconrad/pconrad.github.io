   *Background and Context*: Assessing team members’ indivdiual

   contributions to software development projects poses a key 
   problem for computing instructors. While instructors typically rely on

   subjective assessments, objective assessments could provide
   a more robust picture. To explore this possibility, In a 2020 paper,
   Buffardi presented a correlational analysis of objective metrics and
   subjective metrics in an advanced software engineering project
   course (n= 41 students and 10 teams), finding only two significant
   correlations.

   *Objective*: To explore the robustness of Buffardi’s findings and gain
   further insight, we conducted a larger scale replication of the
   Buffardi study (n = 118 students and 25 teams) in three courses at
   three institutions.

   *Method*: We collected the same data as in the Buffardi study and
   computed the same measures from those data. We replicated
   Buffardi’s exploratory, correlational and regression analyses of
   objective and subjective measures.

   *Findings*: While replicating four of Buffardi’s five significant correlational findings and partially replicating the findings of Buffardi’s regression analyses, our results go beyond those of Buffardi by identifying eight additional significant correlations.

   *Implications*: In contrast to Buffardi’s study, our larger scale study suggests that subjective and objective measures of individual performance in team software development projects can be fruitfully
   combined to provide consistent and complementary assessments
   of individual performance.
