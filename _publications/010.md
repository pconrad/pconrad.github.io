excerpt:
   >-   

   We apply the concept of network-consciousness to image compression,
   an approach that does not simply optimize compression, but which
   optimizes overall performance when compressed images are
   transmitted over a lossy packet-switched network such as the
   Internet. Using an Application Level Framing philosophy, an image
   is compressed into path MTU-size Application Data Units (ADUs) at
   the application layer. Each ADU carries its semantics, that is, it
   contains enough information to be processed independently of all
   other ADUs. Therefore each ADU can be delivered to the receiving
   application out-of-order, thereby enabling faster progressive
   display of images. We explain why this approach is useful in
   general and specifically for wireless/heterogeneous environments.
