excerpt:
   >-   

   Scratch programming has risen in prominence, not only as a
   potential language for K-12 computer science, but also in
   introductory college courses. Unfortunately, grading Scratch
   programs is time-consuming, requiring manual execution of each
   program. Automation of this process is greatly complicated by the
   very reason Scratch is an attractive introductory language—the
   projects are multimedia in nature, requiring eyes and ears to fully
   appreciate.  We propose Hairball, an automated system that can be
   used both by a student to point out potential errors or unsafe
   practices, and by a grader to assist in inspecting the
   implementation of Scratch programs. Because automatic analysis will
   not be able to determine the sensory effect, Hairball focuses
   instead on the implementation, including safe/robust programming
   practices, providing a “lint-like” tool for Scratch.
