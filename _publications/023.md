excerpt:
   >-   

   In prior work, a CMT protocol using SCTP multihoming (termed
   SCTP-based CMT) was proposed and investigated for improving
   application throughput. SCTP-based CMT was studied in
   (bottleneck-independent) wired networking scenarios with ns-2
   simulations. This paper studies the TCP-friendliness of CMT in the
   Internet. In this paper, we surveyed historical developments of the
   TCP-friendliness concept and argued that the original
   TCP-friendliness doctrine should be extended to incorporate
   multihoming and SCTP-based CMT.
