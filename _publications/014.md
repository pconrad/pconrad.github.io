   Traditional image compression techniques seek the smallest possible
   file size for a given level of image quality. By contrast,
   network-conscious image compression techniques take into account
   the fact that a compressed image will be transmitted over a
   packet-switched network that may lose and reorder packets. We
   describe GIFNCa, a network-conscious revision of the popular GIF89a
   standard. As with GIF89a, GIFNCa compresses an image using LZW
   encoding, however GIFNCa does so using an Application Level Framing
   approach. The data is segmented into path MTU-size data units, each
   of which can be independently decompressed and displayed on its
   own. Under lossy network conditions, when used in combination with
   an unordered transport protocol, GIFNCa permits faster progressive
   display at the receiver than GIF89a over an ordered transport
   protocol. This advantage comes in exchange for a small penalty in
   overall compression. This paper defines GIFNCa, and presents
   preliminary experimental data concerning this tradeoff. The overall
   goal of this research is to illustrate (1) the value of considering
   network characteristics in designing image formats, and (2) the
   value of unordered transport service.
