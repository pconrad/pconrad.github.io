title: "ReMDoR: Remote Multimedia Document Retrieval over Partial Order Transport."

excerpt:
   >-   

   This paper presents results from performance experiments that
   demonstrate and quantify performance improvements when a PO/R
   transport service is used instead of an ordered/reliable service
   (O/R e.g., TCP) or an unordered/unreliable service (e.g. UDP). We
   first describe the Remote Multimedia Document Retrieval system
   (ReMDoR), an experimental application developed by the authors to
   evaluate the performance of remote document retrieval over a
   variety of transport protocols. We then provide a detailed analysis
   of experiments comparing O/R service to PO/R service for retrieval
   of a multimedia document. Our results show that between 5% and 10%
   loss, user-perceivable improvements in progressive display are
   obtained when PO/R service is used. These results suggest that when
   packet losses occur in an underlying packet-switched network,
   transport services providing reliable delivery over independent
   streams (such the emerging Internet protocol SCTP) are beneficial
   for retrieval of streaming multimedia.
