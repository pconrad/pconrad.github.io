excerpt:
   >-
   An analytic model is presented for a partially reliable
   transport protocol based on retransmissions. The model illustrates
   tradeoffs between two QoS parameters (delay and throughput), and
   various levels of reliability. The model predicts that the use of a
   reliable transport service when an application only needs a
   partially reliable one causes considerable throughput decreases and
   delay increases in lossy networks. On the other hand, over lossy
   networks, an unreliable transport service is unable to respect an
   application's loss tolerance. In lossy environments, partially
   reliable transport service avoids the extra cost of a reliable
   transport service, and, simultaneously, guarantees the minimal
   reliability that an application requires. A retransmission-based
   partially reliable transport service can be provided through either
   sender-based or receiver-based loss detection and recovery. Results
   show that both techniques provide almost identical reliability and
   delay. However, a sender-based approach provides better throughput
   than a receiver-based approach at high acknowledge loss rates.
