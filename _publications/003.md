excerpt:
   >-   
   Many applications such as video and audio can tolerate loss. When
   the network layer provides a best-effort service such as on the
   Internet, the loss rate of the underlying network service may be
   higher than an application's tolerance for loss. This paper
   analytically studies retransmission-based partially reliable
   transport (layer protocol) service.
