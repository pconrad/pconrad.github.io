title: "Multimedia document retrieval system using partially ordered/partially reliable transport service"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/002
excerpt: 'We investigate the benefits of using a partially-ordered/partially-reliable (PO/PR) transport service for multimedia document retrieval over the Internet by implementing a prototype system. We introduce PMSL, a document specification language combining aspects of Little and Ghafoor's OCPN with features for graceful degradation. We then show that for retrieval of PMSL documents, our PO/PR transport protocol (POCv2) provides several benefits over traditional protocols such as TCP or UDP.'
