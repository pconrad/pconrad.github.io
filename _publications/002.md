title: "Multimedia document retrieval system using partially ordered/partially reliable transport service"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/002
excerpt:
   >-   
    We investigate the benefits of using a
    partially-ordered/partially-reliable (PO/PR) transport service for
    multimedia document retrieval over the Internet by implementing a
    prototype system. We introduce PMSL, a document specification
    language combining aspects of Little and Ghafoor's OCPN with
    features for graceful degradation. We then show that for retrieval
    of PMSL documents, our PO/PR transport protocol (POCv2) provides
    several benefits over tradditional protocols such as TCP or UDP.
