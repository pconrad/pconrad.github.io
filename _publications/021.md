excerpt:
   >-   

   A popular approach to introducing students to computer science is
   to engage
   middle-school students in fun programming activities. One challenge in such
   a program is attracting students who are not already positively predisposed to
   computing. In order to attract a wider audience, we designed and implemented
   a website that integrates culturally relevant activities to appeal to parents and
   children of target groups.
