   Previous work finds that recent college graduates entering the
   software development industry encounter difficulties early in their
   careers, due to significant differences between their coding
   experiences in academia vs. what is expected of them on the job. To
   explore the gap between academic and industry software development,
   we conducted interviews with twenty early career software
   developers with four-year degrees in CS. We present an analysis of
   these interviews, including excerpts in the developers' own words,
   organized around six themes. We conclude with thoughts on how to
   bridge this gap so that our students may be better prepared when we
   launch them into their careers.
