excerpt:
   >-   
    This paper presents an analytic model for investigating the throughput, delay and buffer utilization characteristics of partially ordered transport services. We analyze the effects of packet and ack losses as well as applications' order requirements on overall system performance. The analytic model is verified by comparing its results against those of an OPNET simulation model.
