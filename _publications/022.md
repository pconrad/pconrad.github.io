excerpt:
   >-   

   A popular approach to introducing students to computer science is
   to involve middle-school students in engaging programming
   activities. One challenge in such a program is attracting students
   who are not already positively predisposed to computing.

   In order to attract a diverse audience, we developed a summer
   program based on culturally-relevant themes that appealed to our
   two target audiences, females and Latina/os. This paper describes
   our success in developing and implementing a computing curriculum
   and recruiting materials for a 2-week summer camp integrating two
   themes, animal conservation and Mayan culture. Scratch programming
   was used to engage students in creating animations about animals
   and Mayan culture, allowing them an interdisciplinary experience
   that combined programming, culture, biology, art, and storytelling.

   Our recruiting efforts resulted in an application pool that was 73%
   female and 67% Latina/o, with only 6.5% in neither group. We had 34
   students complete the program. Pre- and post- surveys showed that
   the number of students citing computer science as their top choice
   for a career doubled and interest in computer science as a career
   more than tripled.
