   This paper describes the development of a test environment for
   innovative transport protocols. Central to this work is the
   development of a universal transport library (UTL). The UTL is a
   library of transport protocols that provides application
   programmers the ability to write to a single application
   programming interface (API), then test their application with many
   different transport protocols. The UTL also allows for rapid
   prototyping of transport protocols at the user level. The UTL has
   been incorporated into two multimedia communication systems
   designed to provide better performance over lossy networks by using
   innovative transport protocol features: NETCICATS (a
   Network-Conscious Image Compression and Transmission System) and
   ReMDoR (a Remote Multimedia Document Retrieval system). These three
   tools facilitate the evaluation of flexible transport protocols and
   compression techniques for multimedia communications over lossy
   battlefield networks.
