title: "Achievement Goals in CS1: Replication and Extension"

excerpt:
   >-

   Replication research is rare in CS education. For this reason, it
   is often unclear to what extent our findings generalize beyond the
   context of their generation. The present paper is a replication and
   extension of Achievement Goal Theory research on CS1
   students. Achievement goals are cognitive representations of
   desired competence (e.g., topic mastery, outperforming peers) in
   achievement settings, and can predict outcomes such as grades and
   interest. We study achievement goals and their effects on CS1
   students at six institutions in four countries. Broad patterns are
   maintained&mdash;mastery goals are beneficial while appearance goals
   are not&mdash;but our data additionally admits fine-grained analyses
   that nuance these findings. In particular, students' motivations
   for goal pursuit can clarify relationships between performance
   goals and outcomes.
