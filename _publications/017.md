title: "Simple Reliable Multicast for Parallel Processing in Extended LANs"

excerpt:
   >-   

   A typical problem for a parallel processing system involves
   broadcasting large amounts of data from a master to several worker
   programs. This paper describes a reliable-multicast method to
   reduce the communication costs of this distribution. Our solution
   relies on a tuple-space mechanism as implemented in the Synergy
   system. We present results showing that even a simple
   implementation of reliable multicast can dramatically improve
   performance
