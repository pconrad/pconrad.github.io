excerpt:
   >-   

   Transport layer protocols provide for end-to-end communication
   between two or more hosts. This paper presents a tutorial on
   transport layer concepts and terminology, and a survey of transport
   layer services and protocols. The transport layer protocol TCP is
   used as a reference point, and compared and contrasted with
   nineteen other protocols designed over the past two decades. The
   service and protocol features of twelve of the most important
   protocols are summarized in both text and tables.
