title: "Transport QoS over unreliable networks: no guarantees, no free lunch!"

excerpt:
   >-
   We describe an approach to transport QoS in unreliable networks that focuses on tradeoffs rather than guarantees. In particular, we investigate tradeoffs between qualitative QoS parameters such as order and reliability, and
   quantitative parameters such as delay and throughput.
