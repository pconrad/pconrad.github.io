   Partially ordered transport service offers a middle ground between
   ordered service and unordered service. For applications requiring
   only partial order rather than total order, partially ordered
   service provides performance improvements in terms of delay and
   buffer utilization. Intuitively, one expects a partially ordered
   service to provide relatively greater performance improvement when
   the partial order specied by the service user is more "flexible"
   (i.e., has fewer order constraints) and smaller performance
   improvement when the partial order is less "flexible" (i.e., has
   more order constraints). In this paper, we investigate this notion
   formally by proposing metrics for the "flexibility" of partial
   orders, and determining through an OPNET simulation how well these
   metrics correlate with expected performance.
