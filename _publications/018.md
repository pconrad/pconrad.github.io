excerpt:
   >-   

   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a new Internet
   standards track transport layer protocol SCTP was originally
   designed to transport PSTN signaling messages over IP networks, but
   is also capable of serving as a general purpose transport
   protocol. As such, SCTP provides an alternative that may be better
   able to satisfy the requirements of future battlefield networks
   than the traditional transport protocols, TCP and UDP. Unlike
   traditional transport protocols, SCTP allows multiple streams of
   messages within a single connection (or, in SCTP terminology, a
   single association). As the results in this paper show, this
   ability is particularly helpful in reducing latency for streaming
   multimedia in high loss environments. SCTP also provides features
   for multi-homing that may be helpful in high-mobility environments
   and additional security against denial-of-service attacks based on
   SYN flooding.
