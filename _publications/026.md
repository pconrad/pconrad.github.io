title: "Evaluating Test Suite Effectiveness and Assessing Student Code via Constraint Logic Programming"

excerpt:
   >-   

   A good suite of test inputs is an indispensable tool both for
   manual and automated assessment of student submissions to
   programming assignments. Yet, without a way to evaluate our test
   suites, it is difficult to know how well we are doing, much less
   improve our practice. We present a technique for evaluating a
   hand-generated test suite by comparing its ability to find defects
   against that of a test suite generated automatically using
   Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). We describe our technique and
   present a case study using student submissions for an assignment
   from a second-year programming course. Our results show that a
   CLP-generated test suite was able to identify significant defects
   that the instructor-generated suite missed, despite having similar
   code coverage.
