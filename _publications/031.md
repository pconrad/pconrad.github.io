   Students’ experience with software testing in undergraduate computing courses is often relatively shallow, 
   as compared to the importance of the topic. This experience report describes introducing industrial-strength
   testing into CMPSC 156, an upper division course in software engineering at UC Santa Barbara. We describe
   our efforts to modify our software engineering course to introduce rigorous test-coverage 
   requirements into full-stack web development projects, requirements similar to those the authors had experienced
   in a professional software development setting. We present student feedback on the course and coverage metrics 
   for the projects. We reflect on what about these changes worked (or didn’t), and provide suggestions for other
   instructors that would like to give their students a deeper experience with software testing in their software
   engineering courses.
