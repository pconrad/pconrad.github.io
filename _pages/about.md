My primary responsibilities include teaching undergraduate Computer Science courses in both the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.ucsb.edu) in the [College of Engineering](https://engineering.ucsb.edu) and the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://ucsb.edu).

I am interested in exploring more effective ways to introduce students
to computing and to teach courses in Computer Science.
